    <u><h3>Ingedients:</h3></u>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups semolina</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fine-grain durum wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup orange blossom water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (approximately)</li>
        <li>Date paste (for filling)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>Honey (for drizzling, optional)</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <u><h3>Steps:</h3></u>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the semolina, durum wheat flour, and melted butter or vegetable oil. Mix well until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the orange blossom water while mixing with your hands. Add water, a little at a time, until the dough comes together and is smooth and pliable.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a ball.</li>
        <li>Flatten each dough ball with your hands to form a small circle.</li>
        <li>Place a small amount of date paste in the center of each dough circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough over the date paste to enclose it completely, shaping it into a small cylindrical or crescent shape. Press the edges to seal.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or pot for frying. The oil should be hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the shaped pastries into the hot oil and fry until they turn golden brown. Flip them occasionally to ensure even browning.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the pastries from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Optional: Drizzle the Magroudh pastries with honey and sprinkle sesame seeds on top for added flavor and garnish.</li>
        <li>Allow the pastries to cool before serving.</li>
    </ol>
