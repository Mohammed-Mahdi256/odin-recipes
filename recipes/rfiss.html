    <u><h3>Ingedients:</h3></u>
    <ul class="ingredients-container">
        <div class="ingredients">
            <li>2 cups fine semolina</li>
            <li>1 cup melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </div>
        <div class="ingredients">
            <li>1 teaspoon ground anise seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Almonds, pistachios, or other nuts (optional)</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <u><h3>Steps:</h3></u>
    <ol class="ingredients-container">
        <div class="ingredients">
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the semolina, melted butter or vegetable oil, ground cinnamon, ground anise seeds, and salt. Mix well until the ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Gradually add water while mixing with your hands until the mixture comes together to form a dough. The dough should hold its shape when pressed together.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small portions and shape each portion into small balls or oblong shapes.</li>
            <li>Place the shaped dough on a clean surface or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow the dough to dry and harden for about 1-2 days. This step is important for the texture of the Rfiss.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has dried, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Place the dried dough pieces on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the Rfiss is baking, heat the honey in a saucepan over low heat until it becomes warm and runny.</li>
            <li>Remove the baked Rfiss from the oven and immediately dip each piece into the warm honey. Make sure to coat each piece thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Optional: Garnish the Rfiss with almonds, pistachios, or other nuts while the honey is still sticky.</li>
            <li>Allow the Rfiss to cool and the honey to set before serving.</li>
